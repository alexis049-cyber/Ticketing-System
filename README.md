# Ticketing-System
This project is a fully functional IT Help Desk Ticketing System created using Softr, a powerful no-code platform. Designed to streamline issue tracking and support requests, the system mimics real-world IT environments, making it a great addition to any IT support team.

Below each snapshot of my published Help Desk Lab, there is a description about what is being shown and its intentions for the website.

This is the official landing page of a no-code IT Help Desk ticketing system built using Softr. It features a clean user interface with options to request tool access, new equipment, or a security audit. A sidebar allows users to navigate between submitting requests, viewing their tickets, and managing existing requests.

This snapshot displays the IT request submission form from the Help Desk system, which is the most important section of any ticketing system. Users can select a request category from a dropdown, provide detailed information about their issue, and optionally upload an attachment to support their request. This form simulates a real-world ticket submission process in an IT support environment.

The third snapshot shows the “Tickets assigned to me” section of the ticketing system. It includes filter options by category (Equipment, Security Audit, Tool Access) and status (Done, To Do), along with a search bar to quickly locate tickets. Currently, there are no assigned tickets displayed in the view.
