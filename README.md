# Ticketing-System
This project is a fully functional IT Help Desk Ticketing System created using Softr, a powerful no-code platform. Designed to streamline issue tracking and support requests, the system mimics real-world IT environments, making it a great addition to any IT support team.

Below each snapshot of my published Help Desk Lab, there is a description about what is being shown and its intentions for the website.
